# mese_shop
This mod for minetest is a fusion of a shop and a mesecon button. If you put in what the owner wants, it activates a mese signal for an adjustable number of seconds. You may use it e.g. to open a door to a museum against payment.
Depends on: https://github.com/Jeija/minetest-mod-mesecons and https://github.com/ChaosWormz/minetest-currency.
